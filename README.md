# Differeat

Feasibility study  

 

Project abstract 

The proposed project is to develop a software application called "Differeat" that allows users to input the ingredients they have available and receive recommendations for dishes that can be made with those ingredients. The application will provide the top 5 matching dishes and allow the user to select a specific cuisine (such as Turkish, Chinese, or Italian) for the suggested recipes. 

 

Project description and competitor analysis 

The problem 

Students often face multiple challenges when it comes to cooking at home. One of the main issues is the lack of knowledge and experience in preparing meals, as many students have never learned basic cooking techniques or recipes. 

Additionally, many students have busy schedules, which limits the time available for cooking and meal preparation. Furthermore, students may not have access to a wide range of ingredients due to limited budgets or living arrangements, which can make meal planning and preparation difficult.  

Despite these challenges, students still desire to enjoy delicious, healthy, and homemade food as part of a balanced lifestyle. 

The solution  

Our solution is to address the problems faced by students who have difficulty cooking with a software application called "Differeat".  

The application will provide a simple and user-friendly interface that allows the user to input the ingredients they have available, select the desired cuisine, and receive a list of the top 5 recipes that can be made with those ingredients. The recipes will be curated from reliable sources and will be easy to follow, even for novice cooks. 

To address the time constraint issue, the application will prioritize recipes that can be made quickly, such as those that can be prepared within 30 minutes or less. In addition, the app will suggest recipes that require minimal preparation and clean-up time. 

To overcome the problem of limited ingredient availability, the application will be designed to suggest recipes that require only a few basic ingredients, along with a few that the user may not have but are easily obtainable. The recipes will also be flexible and will allow the user to substitute ingredients if necessary. 

To further enhance the user experience, the application may also allow users to save their favourite recipes, create shopping lists, and share recipes with friends and family through social media. 

 

The competitor's analysis 

In order to assess the market for the proposed "Differeat" application, a competitor analysis was conducted. The analysis revealed several competitors and alternative solutions that may pose a challenge to the success of the project: 

ChatGPT and other generative AI: These AI-based language models have the capability to generate recipes based on ingredients, but they may lack the human touch and practicality in terms of real-world cooking experience. They are primarily text-based and may not provide a user-friendly interface or additional features. 

Classic cooking websites: Traditional cooking websites such as Food Network, Allrecipes, and BBC Good Food offer a vast collection of recipes, but users may need to search and filter through a large database to find recipes that match their available ingredients. 

Social media influencers: Influencers on platforms like YouTube and Instagram often share their own recipes, but these may not be tailored to the specific needs and limitations of students, such as budget-friendly options or limited ingredient availability. 

Other recipe apps like SuperCook, Allrecipes Dinner Spinner, Epicurious, and Cookpad: These apps allow users to search for recipes based on available ingredients, but they may not cater specifically to students and their unique challenges in terms of time constraints, limited ingredients, and cooking skills. 

Differeat could stand out by being created by students for students. It could offer budget-friendly recipes, easy-to-make options, and ingredient substitution flexibility, all tailored to students' specific needs and limitations. The user interface could be simple and intuitive, with the potential to add meal planning, grocery list creation, and social sharing options later on. 

 

Project scope 

The prototype should be able to: 

User Input: Allow users to input the ingredients they have available for cooking through a simple user interface that allows users to select from a predefined list of ingredients in a database 

Recipe Matching: Implement a matching algorithm that takes the user-inputted ingredients and matches them with recipes in a database.  

Recipe Display: Display the top 5 matching recipes to the user, along with relevant details such as recipe name, ingredients, and cooking instructions. 

Cuisine Selection: Allow users to choose a specific cuisine (e.g., Turkish, Chinese, Italian) for the recipe recommendations.  

Basic User Management: Implement basic user management functionality, such as user registration and login, to allow users to save their favourite recipes, view their search history, and personalize their experience.
